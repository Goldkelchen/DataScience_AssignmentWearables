Codebook to peergraded assignment (Data Science, Week 4) on wearables data

What did i do with the data?

Get Started
# Load relevant librarys into R
# Unzip data and store
# Read and understand provided information on activity data set by Samsung wearables

###### Task 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
# Names: Column names for columns 1-561 of "x_..." are contained in features.txt

# Read Train data in, append the labels & subject identifier, provide names of features.txt to each column
# Merge train data

# Read Train data in, append the labels & subject identifier, provide names of features.txt to each column
# Merge train data

## Merge test and train datasets

###### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# Find the Integer Column numbers of the relevant data

###### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# Read in activities
# Rename activities

###### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

###### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
######    with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Store result
# The columns result$labels and result$subject indicate the values applied for each row. Each row hence contains the mean data for a specific combination of label and subject.
# End



How did i name the variables?

The naming distinguishes: 
- acceleration - body acceleration signals using "acceleration" in the variable name and
- gyroscope - angular velocity measured by the gyroscope as "gyroscope" and
- angles - the denotation "angles" describes an angle between the 3-dimensional vectors of 2 variables

Mean values and standard deviations
- in case a variable is a standard deviation (std) it is denoted in the very end of the variable name as "std"
- all other variables are mean values of the respective measurement

Time and frequency
- in case the value returns the frequency of a measurement in 50hz (1/50s), this is indicated by "freq"
- all other variables are time measurements

Directions
- in case a variable is measured only in a specific direction, the direction is indicated in the end of the variable by e.g. "x" or "x_std"

Jerk and Magnitude measurements
- In case the magnitude or the jerk was measured, this is indicated in the varialble name.
